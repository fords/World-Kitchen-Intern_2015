 The power supply and RSLogix500 are attached in the electrical panel. Wires are connected from RSLogix500 to vision camera and photo electronic sensor. The photo electronic sensor tells the camera to take pictures via RSLogix ladder logic. When vision camera sees the broken plates, it sends a signal to RSLogix500 PLC output connected to slider throwing them away. Otherwise, let the plates pass. For the programming, the FIFO stack is implemented to store the information about good and broken dishes since there is delay time between the camera taking a picture and the slides being open to throw the dishes. The HMI, implemented with Factorytalk View, asked user and password to edit changes in the program. There are some changes that can be made such as delay time, how long the slides being open to let the dishes being thrown out and switching to manual mode in order to stop the process or program. It also updates the information about the time when there is jam on the conveyors.
